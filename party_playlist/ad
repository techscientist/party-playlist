path = uac_bypass(file)

This function will only operate when your program is installed
check the is_installed function for details

Moves working data to another folder. The idea is to get around
security and uac on windows vista +

returns cwd on linux, windows returns path with write
access: C:\ProgramData\appname here

if a file is passed in it will be appended to the path

set create to true to create the file in the programData folder

setting overwrite to True will silently overwrite, otherwise a
FileExistsError is raised

Setting overwrite to get, will get the file path instead of throwing an error

                                                ---Background----
If a user is using windows, Read write access is restriced in the
Program Files directory without prompting for uac.

We create a folder in c:\Program Data\ of the program name and
save logging data etc there.

This way the program doesnt need admin rights.
